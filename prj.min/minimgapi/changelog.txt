MINIMGAPI Changelog

Version 2.1.1
11-Jul-2013



+++ New functionality:

+ Added macros for manipulating with single bits of images

GET_IMAGE_LINE_BIT(p, x)
Returns value of x-th bit of image line pointed by p. If bit is on,
returns not just 1, but returns it in the same position within byte,
in which it was within the image byte.

SET_IMAGE_LINE_BIT(p, x)
Sets x-th bit of image line pointed by p to be 1.

CLEAR_IMAGE_LINE_BIT(p, x)
Sets x-th bit of image line pointed by p to be 0.

INVERT_IMAGE_LINE_BIT(p, x)
Switches the value of x-th bit of image line pointed by p.


+ Added set of functions for filling MinImg structure as a pointer to some
special cases of user memory buffer (similar to WrapSolidBufferWithMinImage)

MINIMGAPI_API int WrapScalarWithMinImage(
    MinImg *p_image,
    void   *p_scalar,
    MinTyp  element_type);
The function fills MinImg structure to represent user scalar as one-channel,
one-pixel image.

MINIMGAPI_API int WrapPixelWithMinImage(
    MinImg *p_image,
    void   *p_pixel,
    int     channels,
    MinTyp  element_type);
The function fills MinImg structure to represent user scalar as one-pixel image.

MINIMGAPI_API int WrapScalarVectorWithMinImage(
    MinImg          *p_image,
    void            *p_vector,
    int              size,
    DirectionOption  direction,
    MinTyp           element_type);
The function fills MinImg structure to represent user vector of scalars as
one-line image (horizontal or vertical, depending on @c direction).

MINIMGAPI_API int WrapPixelVectorWithMinImage(
    MinImg          *p_image,
    void            *p_vector,
    int              size,
    DirectionOption  direction,
    int              channels,
    MinTyp           element_type);
The function fills MinImg structure to represent user vector of pixels as
one-line image (horizontal or vertical, depending on @c direction).


+ Added some functions for checking whether image prototype fits
given conditions of not

MINIMGAPI_API int AssureMinImageFits(
    const MinImg *p_image,
    MinTyp        element_type,
    int           channels      IS_BY_DEFAULT(-1),
    int           width         IS_BY_DEFAULT(-1),
    int           height        IS_BY_DEFAULT(-1));
The function checks the image header for congruence with given parameters.
Parameters given as -1 are considered not restricted and are not checked.

MINIMGAPI_API int AssureMinImageIsScalar(
    const MinImg *p_image);
The function checks whether image has exactly one element (channel) or not.

AssureMinImageIsPixel(
    const MinImg *p_image);
The function checks whether image has exactly one pixel or not.


+ Added functions to check if two images have the same type of contents

MINIMGAPI_API int CompareMinImagePixels(
    const MinImg *p_image_a,
    const MinImg *p_image_b);
The function compares types of elements (channels) and number of channels
in pixels of two images.

MINIMGAPI_API int CompareMinImageTypes(
    const MinImg *p_image_a,
    const MinImg *p_image_b);
The function compares types of elements (channels) of two images.


+ Added function to copy fragment of an image into fragment of another one

MINIMGAPI_API int CopyMinImageFragment(
    const MinImg *p_dst_image,
    const MinImg *p_src_image,
    int           dst_x0,
    int           dst_y0,
    int           src_x0,
    int           src_y0,
    int           width,
    int           height);
The function copies fragment of one image to fragment of another.
It was nesessary for manipulation with bit images, because it's fragments
can be not byte-aligned.


+ Added function to resample an image, that is //////TODO: add description

MINIMGAPI_API int ResampleMinImage(
    const MinImg *p_dst_image,
    const MinImg *p_src_image,
    double        x_phase IS_BY_DEFAULT(0.5),
    double        y_phase IS_BY_DEFAULT(0.5));
The function resamples an image in the sense of changing image sample rate.
The source image pixels are copied to destination one as whole entities,
with no interpolation.



*** Functionality changes:

* MINIMGAPI_API int CheckMinImagesTangle(
    uint32_t     *p_result,
    const MinImg *p_dst_image,
    const MinImg *p_src_image)
The function was significantly reworked.

* MINIMGAPI_API int FillMinImage(
    const MinImg *p_image,
    const void   *p_canvas,
    int           value_size)
Now it's possible to fill image with multi-pixel pattern
(but each line fills individually, restarting pattern).

* MINIMGAPI_API int InterleaveMinImages(
    const MinImg        *p_dst_image,
    const MinImg *const *p_p_src_images,
    int                  num_src_images)
Stub was replaced with actual implementation.

* MINIMGAPI_API int TransposeMinImage(
    const MinImg *p_dst_image,
    const MinImg *p_src_image)
Refactored, added implementation for bit images.

* MINIMGAPI_API int CopyMinImageChannels(
    const MinImg *p_dst_image,
    const MinImg *p_src_image,
    const int    *p_dst_channels,
    const int    *p_src_channels,
    int           num_channels)
The function was refactored.

* Some functions have got internal inline implementatilns, so minimgapi
has been generally accelerated.



### Fixed bugs:

# CloneMinImagePrototype fixed for case where p_dst_image == p_src_image.
Now it correctly provies that destination image has the same prototype
as the source one, regardless the image headers are the same or not.

# GetMinImageRegion fixed for case where p_dst_image == p_src_image.
Now in that case it returns BAD_ARGS or gets subimage correctly,
depending on rules parameter.

# Additonal assurance added in AssureMinImageIsValid to check that image lines
do not intersect in memory.

# Copying of solid images fixed in CopyMinImage. Before stride of the image was
usde instead of image width (in bytes). That can differ for one-line images.

# CopyMinImage fixed for bit images with length non-multiple of 8.
