/**
 * @defgroup MinUtils_MinImg Image Representation
 * @brief    The module specifies the image representation format. Every
 *           function in the library expects an input image in the form of @c
 *           MinImg object. @c MinImg is a cross-platform open-source container.
 *           The advantages of this container are the using minimal number of
 *           fields needed to represent the bitmap image and the easy way to
 *           cast it to other standard and popular view (for instance, Windows
 *           DIB, GDI+ BitmapData, Intel/OpenCV IplImage).

/**
 * @brief   A low-level universal representation of a bitmap image.
 * @details The struct @c MinImg represents a 2D dense numerical with additional
 *          fields needed for image representations (format and channel number).
 *          The struct @c MinImg allows to describe single-channel and multi-
 *          channel images in a wide range of different image types. Herewith,
 *          the format of the image is specified by two values: depth of the
 *          channel (see @c MinImg::channelDepth) and channel element format
 *          (see @c MinImg::format). To represent a binary image you should set
 *          @c MinImg::format to @c #FMT_UINT and @c MinImg::channelDepth to 0.
 * @ingroup MinUtils_MinImg
