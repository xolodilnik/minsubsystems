/**

 * @brief    The module describes the @c stdint.h file with is a header file in 
 *           the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library 
 *           section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code by 
 *           providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types,
 *           together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for
 *           each type, using macros. This header is particularly useful for 
 *           embedded programming which often involves considerable manipulation
 *           of hardware specific I/O registers requiring integer data of fixed
 *           widths, specific locations and exact alignments.
