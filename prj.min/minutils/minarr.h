/**
 * @brief   A multi-dimensional dense multi-channel array representation.
 * @details The struct @c MinArr represents a multi-dimensional dense numerical 
 *          single-channel or multi-channel array. The data layout of the array
 *          is defined by the field @c MinArr::pStrides. Let us @f$ M @f$ is an 
 *          instance of @c MinArr. So the address of element 
 *          @f$ (i_0,...,i_{M.dim - 1}) @f$, where @f$ 0 \le i_k \le M.pSizes[k] @f$ 
 *          is computed as:
 *            @f[ M.pStart+M.pStrides[0]*i_0+...+M.pStrides[M.dim-1]*i_{M.dim - 1} @f]
 *          For example, in the case of 2-dimensional array the above formula is 
 *          reduced to: 
 *            @f[ M.pStart+M.pStrides[0]*i+M.pStrides[1]*j @f]
 *          Note that @f$ M.pStrides[i] \ge M.pStrides[i+1] @f$ that is, 2-dimensional 
 *          matrices are stored row-by-row, 3-dimensional matrices are stored plane-by 
 *          plane etc. @f$ M.pStrides[M.dim-1] @f$ is minimal and always equal to the 
 *          element size @f$ M.channelDepth @f$.
