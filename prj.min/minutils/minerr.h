/**
 * @defgroup MinUtils_MinErr Possible Return Codes
 * @brief    The module specifies the return values used thought the library.
 *           Every function in the library follows the rule: it returns integer
 *           value. Meanwhile, a nonnegative return value indicates that the
 *           function completed successfully whereas a negative value indicates
 *           erroneous execution and specifies the error code. The enum @c #MinErr
 *           contains codes for the most common errors. It is convenient enough
 *           to use special defines for handling return codes. Below you can find
 *           two defines which are widely used in the library.
